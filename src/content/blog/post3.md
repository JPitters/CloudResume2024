More text goes here.... But to give my take on the question in the description,
"Rules" are set, whereas "Laws" are foundational; "you can break a rule, but you cannot break a law, it would 
instead break you". For instance, the "Laws of Physics" are laws because they preceed and operate as the 
foundation of all understandings. Was it really that difficult to figure out, Newton?
