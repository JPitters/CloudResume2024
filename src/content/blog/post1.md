Hello readers!!! For some time now, I have felt that I would like to make myself a blog, or portfolio, 
and use it to present some of my more... inspirational ideas. Alas, I struggled to muster up the passion 
to start the project. One thing that helped me hold interest in this personal project is the main goal: 
experience! At the very least, the experience it adds is valuable, as 'in all labor, there is profit~' 
(or however you say it...).

I'm not exactly a blogger, more of a philosophical thinker, still I'll give this a good effort and see 
how it goes... but as they say in someone's motherland, "give everything a good effort; you can always 
try, and if you don't succeed the first time... skydiving is not for you." Luckily, I'm becoming more of 
a cloud enthusiast than a skydiver. Hence the "Solutions Architect" title on the Home page... unless I 
changed it by the time you're reading this. Regardless, let's talk goals: Life & Solutions Architecture.

For a while, I floated in the Software Development field, mostly working on webapps and such, forever waiting 
on something that would just hit me over the head and wake me up. And then life happened. I got a girlfriend, 
I traveled a lot, hung out with my brothers, AI popped up out the darkness and shook the coins out of me - 
it was mostly great! However, I also came to understand what I am most passionate about. I look forward to 
a life of successfully supporting others and providing my loved ones with great experiences, while working
on things that actually interest me. So, I started to research tech solutions. A lot. Eventually, I came upon 
the "new" multi-cloud standard of Cloud Architecture, and it intrigued me... aaaand it pays fairly well. Even
then, the Multi-Cloud Architect "wall" seemed fairly steep (I guess they don't call 'em Cloud Architects for 
nothing, *badum tss*). Holding this ember of new-found passion, I actually feel eager to scale the 
aforementioned wall, so... I'm doing my best to give it a good effort. 

Now, why should I care about multi-cloud skills? Well, picture this: you're in a hypothetical tech dystopia 
where all the cool kids are talking about AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud like they're Pokémon. You don't want to 
be the one stuck with just a Squirtle when the world (your Enterprise Apps) also needs a Charizard, right? 
Embracing multi-cloud isn't just about keeping up with trends; it's about future-proofing my skills.

So, how can this humble blog/portfolio project help me? Let's break it down:

-> Research and Planning: Just like building a blog, navigating multi-cloud environments requires meticulous planning. I'll spend some time researching different cloud providers, their services, pricing models, and best practices. I could start with a roadmap for each option, but I think each Cloud Service Provider(CSP) isn't too different. My main learning goal is to understand the underlying tech: why they do what they do, what is it meant for, how they do it, etc.. 

-> Hands-on Practice: As my Prof. would say: "Theory is great, but nothing beats getting your hands dirty." I plan to experiment with different CSPs and use the efforts of developing this website to practice! Although, I am currently leaning towards hosting with AWS. 

-> Networking and Community Engagement: I have already joined a few online communities, and met some great people during meet-ups in various locations! For example, I flew from Toronto to Atlanta in March for an engineering event, which I'll get more into in a different post. 

-> Continuous Learning: This is one of the hardest parts for me - the world of cloud computing is constantly evolving, so I'll need to stay on my toes. Keeping up with the latest trends, updates, and certifications, is good for anyone in the IT field, but I tend to get very drawn into projects and ignore the tech I don't use. I tend to view it as a quest for knowledge – like trying to collect all the Infinity Stones, but I didn't bother with the other ones because the green one is my favorite.

So there you have it – I have a vision, passion, and a hunger for growth. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must carry on with my studies. Thanks for reading!
